Project Description:
When launched the application will open to a form that will allow the user to choose between 3 options.
When the user chooses the numbering option, they will be asked to enter values, from randomly genereated values, that will be added to a list box that will check 
if the values are sorted in ascending order.
If they are, a user will win a point.
If they aren't a user will lose a point.
